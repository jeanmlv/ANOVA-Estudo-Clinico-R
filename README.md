# Clinical Study — ANOVA

> Simulation of a clinical study comparing three distinct treatment groups using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) for mean comparisons. The project includes assumption checks (normality, homogeneity of variances), data visualization with ggplot2, and post-hoc Tukey tests. Developed in R as part of my portfolio in clinical data analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

- This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three different treatments in a clinical trial using ANOVA to determine statistically significant differences between group means. The analysis includes:
  
   - Assumption testing (normality, variance homogeneity)
   - One-way ANOVA for mean comparison
   - Post-hoc Tukey tests to identify specific group differences

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: R
- **Packages**:
  - `ggplot2` – data visualization
  - `dplyr` – data manipulation
  - `car` – Levene’s test for variance homogeneity
